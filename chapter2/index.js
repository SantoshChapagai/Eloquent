// Looping a triangle
// Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
for(let i = "#"; i.length <= 7; i+= "#"){
    console.log(i)
  }


//FizzBuzz
// Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

// When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

function fizz(n){
    for(let i = 1; i <=n; i++){
        if(i%3 ===0 && i%5===0){

// Chessboard
// Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
